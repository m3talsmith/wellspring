## Day

I remember a day, traveling through the air, a future in my head yet to be born; being pulled through the earth in a filthy subway; walking the last blocks to the tenemant turned headquarters; fire flowing in my veins.

I remember being welcomed and introduced to my comrades; being shown around. To the printers, the editor, the secratariat, and the bathrooms.

I remember the many greeting cards and letters from our international, spilling across what used to be a borgiouses' secretary desk area. Congratulations from our comrades in China, mixed with letters of solidarity from Vietnam, Turkey, and so on.

I remember discussions amongst each other about this or that platrform point. The Green New Deal, where the workers could be reliably found, who are the modern proliteriate.

I remember taking calls from my co-workers - fixing problems that did not affect the revolution to come - while hammering out the details of new systems with comrades; of mixing the mundane capitalist worries, with ideas set to escape them.

I remember ducking out to get some food; some people around me with masks donned, wary eyed, keeping their distance, and moving beyond me as fast as possible; the lack of the usual city crush, the brightness of the sky.

I remember the fatigue; a catnap on the floor of a conference room, my hoodie for a pillow, lights off, but still pouring through the windows; sleep taking me.

## Night

I remember a night, wrapped up in a hoodie; strategizing with comrades on Discord; writing proclamations in html for an obscure site; feeling a confidence I had not earned.

I remember my first Vietnamese coffee - to fuel more meetings; the small kitchenette, open to all on the single floor; of covert hikes up and down the flight of stairs neighboring the building; the strangers brushing past in the alley.

I remember two comrades, having driven from entirely other states, and I, heads together to solve the problem of belated communication to new members.

I remember later of newer comrades, disgusted by the holdings of the party not being liquidated to provide for the social needs of the workers outside of our reach.

I remember th bed; a pillow case smelling of slight must; the blanket scratchy, but warm; falling asleep in my clothes; then morning.

# The next day

I remember the warmth of fresh bagels; the hot breath of coffee; the muted noise of a large city waking up.

I remember the reverse trip of the day before; more masks on more people, scurrying to their places of work or errands; grabbing a slice and waiting for hours for the sub to show; it being dark by the time my flight lifted off.

I remember having been so caught up in revolutionary work, that I wasn't caught on the news.

I remember JFK being shut down; news of a virus from another country.

I remember the first days of Covid, as a series of revolutionary actions.

And then I was home.
