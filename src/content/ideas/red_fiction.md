## Where We Stand Historically

There are plenty of socialist and communist works that are generally against the subject matter; distopias, utopias, and the like (though more distopian than utopian as time passes).

Many of these written with the intent to scare people from being involved in the struggle, or to become even supporters of red ideas.

Red baiting is real and frequent in fiction as in the real world.

## Fight with Tools

I'd rather lead through inspiration, than fear.

I am starting to put down socialist ideas through character driven stories. Instead of writing in a utopian setting, where we've already achieved our revolutions, the writing will be done through the pains of struggle, so that the achievements bare teeth - provide the readers with concepts that they can use in the struggle.
