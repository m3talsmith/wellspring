    <h1>Creeping</h1>
    <p>One handful of musty leaves and mud. Another inch forward. A trail of blood growing across my face.</p>
<p><em>ACAB! ACAB! ACAB!</em></p>
<p>The flank is collapsing and I only have a limited time to escape.</p>
<p>Gods, the noise!</p>
<p>My poor swelling head, pounding, ears buzzing; but I can't be caught. I pat my chest to ensure that the letters are still there.</p>
<p>I reach another hand forward.</p>
<p>Somewhere near my hip, a stick is poking me. Fighting my progress forward. I roll and crawl and progress another few inches. Not an easy task with one immobilized arm.</p>
<p>Those cops, they must have been cops, that struck me off handed, must have hit a nerve. My left arm dragging limply along side my body.</p>
<p><em>Through the slow arch of time, the flame trilling through a parrabola, one of many bottles hurled by the masses, headed for armored bodies. Smashing, bursting forth in flame. Blinding for a moment a portion of the wall of attackers. A flare in the night.</em></p>
<p>I kick with my legs and inch forward towards the tree. Thirty more feet to go.</p>
<p><em>Guns ringing out in response. A scream rends the air. More groaning bodies fall on the forest floor.</em></p>
<p>I pull the scarf tighter over my face and stretch my shoulders my shoulders, testing my numb arm. My fingers are starting to get some feeling again.</p>
<p><em>The rush forward, exhilarating in its daring. All those voices shouting as one, all those bodies pushing forward. The house within our grasps. Bullets shrilly screaming over our heads. Not close enough to give us pause.</em></p>
<p>I shouldn't have taken this mission. This is why I never go to protests. Who's plan was it to take the Mayor's mansion anyways? Probably an FBI informant giving bad ideas to ensnare the movement in the vague hope that enough of us would get snatched up, to not realize who the snitch was.</p>
<p>We have to keep an eye out for the adventurous and zealous. The feds have ears planted everywhere, that we are sure of; but it's adventurism taken up by their hands covertly, that we must really protect against. Their manipulations to divide or break us are laced with this.</p>
<p><em>A woman struggles to free herself. Non-descript men are bottling her in, hands firmly on her arms and shoulders, trying to bow and herd her. A shout! The kicking fury of heavy boots, trampling and collapsing the knees of some of the attackers.</em></p>
<p>Ten more feet and I am covered in grime. There's more than mud and leaves, sticks and rocks, here. Pools of puke and viscera soak into the ground slowly.</p>
<p><em>A flag is planted firmly, proudly on the other side of the front. Red as blood, as life poured out, it waves with claims of overcoming. Hands firmly holding it up, calling for others to join them.</em></p>
<p>Behind the house, I leverage the cellar door open. Fortunate that the owners hadn't locked it. I crouch and stretch my legs, stalking into the unlit room.</p>
<p>Turning a flash for my phone on, scanning the room, I search for a safe soft place to rest. I take the packet of letters out of my hoodie. Nothing damaged.</p>
<p>With only two hours left before my contact shows, I slump in a corner and weep.</p>
<p><em>Uniformed officers pour out of the forest, their aim a pile of limbs struggling over the liberation of their comrades from the grasps of the officers counterparts on the ground. They speed up, slamming into the group with their shields, shouldering in to build an aggressive formation around the arrested woman: occasionally snatching out to drag a protestor into their grasp, to arrest them.</em></p>
<p>There is a great creeping quiet growing now. The flag has been torn down, the protestors scattered or arrested. I close my eyes to the world.</p>
<p><em>Death explodes as quickly as a gun shot. Her head snapped back and body twists as a marionette does when some strings have been cut loose. The masses lash out in horror.</em></p>
<p><em>The truncheons fall like axes, chopping down one by one, those who tried to save her. Her murderers bully and brutishly rage.</em></p>
<p>I read my orders once more.</p>
<p><em>"To those that find these letters, you have seen the cost. The state do not let the revolution grow easily. In here, are the signs of its demise. Copy them, spread them, take care of yourselves. The revolution does not die here, it has just been born again."</em></p>

    <h1>Red Fiction</h1>
    <h2 id="where-we-stand-historically">Where We Stand Historically</h2>
<p>There are plenty of socialist and communist works that are generally against the subject matter; distopias, utopias, and the like (though more distopian than utopian as time passes).</p>
<p>Many of these written with the intent to scare people from being involved in the struggle, or to become even supporters of red ideas.</p>
<p>Red baiting is real and frequent in fiction as in the real world.</p>
<h2 id="fight-with-tools">Fight with Tools</h2>
<p>I'd rather lead through inspiration, than fear.</p>
<p>I am starting to put down socialist ideas through character driven stories. Instead of writing in a utopian setting, where we've already achieved our revolutions, the writing will be done through the pains of struggle, so that the achievements bare teeth - provide the readers with concepts that they can use in the struggle.</p>
