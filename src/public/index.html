<p>What you are reading is a collections of ideas, characters, and stories, scrabbled out and sorted for future books. I hope to keep this updated and current as sketches of what could be, but won't be putting full novels in here.</p>
<p>Instead, I'll provide links to proper works, should they ever grow out of this.</p>
<p>Happy reading and all the best!</p>

    <h1>Red Fiction</h1>
    <h2 id="where-we-stand-historically">Where We Stand Historically</h2>
<p>There are plenty of socialist and communist works that are generally against the subject matter; distopias, utopias, and the like (though more distopian than utopian as time passes).</p>
<p>Many of these written with the intent to scare people from being involved in the struggle, or to become even supporters of red ideas.</p>
<p>Red baiting is real and frequent in fiction as in the real world.</p>
<h2 id="fight-with-tools">Fight with Tools</h2>
<p>I'd rather lead through inspiration, than fear.</p>
<p>I am starting to put down socialist ideas through character driven stories. Instead of writing in a utopian setting, where we've already achieved our revolutions, the writing will be done through the pains of struggle, so that the achievements bare teeth - provide the readers with concepts that they can use in the struggle.</p>
